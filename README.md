Steps to get the build running on localhost (make sure you have nodejs and npm installed)
1. open the project folder in an ide or inside a command line
2. run the command "npm install" this will install all the dependencies needed
3a. run the command "npm start" this will start the app in dev mode on localhost allowing for changes to be shown quickly
3b. alternatively run the command "npx serve -s build" to deploy the build of the app (changes will not be shown in this mode until "npm run build" is executed)
